# Angle of Attack Sensor Code Base (Arduino)
This repository is for the Angle of Attack Sensor, which runs on 
- an Arduino Nano 33 IOT 
- an Arduino Nano 33 BLE board 
- (this is new) an Arduino RP2040 Connect board. 

This code is posted here for those with a desire to modify or customize it for their own use. If you know what to do with it, you probably understand how to create your own git branch and update it however you wish. It's open source, so feel free to improve it for your own use. Regardless of whether you use my code directly or change it for your own purposes, you do so at your own risk and at the risk of your passengers. You, as pilot in command, have ultimate reponsibility for the safe outcome of every flight. 

If you find an issue with the code (or simply have a better way to do something), feel free to create an issue and add a lot of details. I may or may not do something about it. 

# Disclaimer:
By using this Angle of Attack Sensor (sensor) and/or Angle of Attack Indicator software (indicator), you agree with the following:
- you understand and agree that, while the sensor and indicator can contribute to better situational awareness in the cockpit, they are NOT designed or certified to be used as/by a primary flight instrument
- you understand and agree that the data produced by the sensor and/or the indicator will NOT be used as/by a primary flight instrument
- you understand and agree that the pilot in command is SOLELY responsible for the safe outcome of every flight
- the pilot in command accepts FULL responsibility for any accident, harm, death, and/or loss that occurs while using the sensor and/or indicator
- the pilot in command has briefed all passengers and all passengers agree to the same
- the pilot in command (and each passenger) agrees to NOT hold the designer and/or builder of the sensor and/or indicator responsible for any accident, harm, death and/or loss that occurs while using the sensor and/or indicator, unless the designer and/or builder is the designated pilot in command during the flight
